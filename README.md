# Password-Generator

- Motivation: To provide a user with a password generator with their choice of length and characters.
- Why I built this: To learn and show how I can use Javascript for such purposes as above.
- Problem solved: A password is randomly generated for a user wanting to select the length of the password and if they want lower cased, upper cased, numbers and/or special characters.
- I learned: How to use Javascript for randomly selecting an element of an array, 'while' loops, and creating and adding to a string using a function.
